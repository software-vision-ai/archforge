# archforge-ui-egui

**Purpose.** The user interface: Home, the start screen, the New project dialog over it, and the
workspace once a project is open (`workspace`: the project bar, the activity rail and the Models
explorer over the session (`explorer`: schemas, tables, columns and skills; `+` adds, a name is
typed in place, Delete asks when other things go with it),
the diagram tab strip with its new-diagram control over the empty canvas, the right rail between
the canvas and its panel, the status bar), drawn from the design with its own palette, type and
icons (`ux`). An open project has an in-memory ER session (`Shell::session`); nothing reaches the
project's database yet, and the status bar says so once there is something unsaved.

**Layer.** 7, over `archforge-er` (6), `archforge-core` (5), `archforge-mof` (4), `archforge-engine` (3) and
`archforge-names`; the only library crate that may use the toolkit (egui). The shell never reads
the clock or the file system: the ids of a model's elements come from the host (`Services::ids`).

**Binding rules.** The shell rules, the localisation rules (`i18n/`), and the layering rule that
the shell never touches the file system: the host injects `Services`. Controls whose screens are
not built yet are drawn as designed, take no click and say "Not available yet" on hover; a panel
or explorer with nothing to show says so in one line, never with a help text.

**Public API.**

| Item | Signature |
|---|---|
| `Shell::new` | `pub fn new(services: Services) -> Shell` |
| `Shell::logic` | `pub fn logic(&mut self, ctx: &egui::Context)` (once per frame, before drawing) |
| `Shell::ui` | `pub fn ui(&mut self, ui: &mut egui::Ui)` (draws the whole window) |
| `Shell::request_quit` | `pub fn request_quit(&mut self)` (closes the window at the next frame) |
| `Shell::open_project`, `Shell::close_project` | `pub fn open_project(&mut self, opened: Opened)`, `pub fn close_project(&mut self)`: the workspace replaces Home and back |
| `Shell::project`, `Shell::session`, `Shell::session_error` | the open project, its ER session (made once per project through `archforge_er::new_project_session`), why none could be made |
| `Shell::location` | `pub fn location(&self) -> Option<String>`: where the project lives, as the status bar says it |
| `state::{Explorer, Panel}` | the workspace's explorer and right panel, part of `UiState` |
| `Shell::widgets` | `pub fn widgets(&self) -> &[widgets::Entry]` (the controls of the last frame, by automation id) |
| `Shell::top_inset` | `pub top_inset: f32`, a field: the logical pixels at the top the host draws over (the macOS title bar) |
| `Services` | host functions: the installed fonts, the account's name, the folder new projects go in, the projects host, the id source for a model's elements |
| `ProjectHost` | `fn create(&self, folder: &Path, name: &str) -> Receiver<Result<Opened, CreateError>>` (the host creates on its own thread) |
| `Opened`, `CreateError` | an open project; why a creation failed, in the kinds the dialog explains |
| `UiState` | the stored appearance, language, Home's closed banner, the workspace's explorer and panel and their widths |
| the title strip's controls | `strip.home`, `strip.open-project`, `strip.theme` on every screen; on the workspace `strip.home` closes the project |
| `i18n::{tr, tr_ctx, trn, set_language}` | catalogue lookups at draw time |
| `offscreen::render` | `pub fn render(width: f32, height: f32, scale: f32, theme: ThemeKind) -> Result<(u32, u32, Vec<u8>), String>` (feature `snapshot`) |
| `offscreen::render_screen` | the same for a `Screen`: Home, the New project dialog over it, the workspace, or the workspace with its first schema being named |
| `explorer::{State, add, remove_selection, rows, fresh_name, Kind}` | the Models explorer's state and the actions the tests and the host drive |
| `new_project::{open, name_problem, file_name}` | the New project dialog: open it, a name's problem in words, the file a name gives |
| `Folder` | a folder as the shell shows it: its path and its label |

**Non-goals.** The screens behind Home's other controls, the Diagrams and Source Control
explorers' contents, the panels' fields and the canvas: slices W3 and W4 of the workspace chrome,
then their own rows.
